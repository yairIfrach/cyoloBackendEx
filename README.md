If you've made it this far I hope you continue to enjoy!
Here are two endpoints, one for adding words and the other for reading the report.

1. Adding the words is quite simple (because it is said that this is the process that receives more requests) after receiving the words a pressurization happens and they enter the object of the "db" (local)

2. In every report request: we will extract the entire "db" and run on it the necessary manipulations such as top 5, minimum value, etc.

I hope the code is clear and understandable and I met all the requirements
I would love to hear comments.
